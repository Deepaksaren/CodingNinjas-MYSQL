SQL Commands
● Types of SQL statements/commands -
1. DDL(Data Definition language)
2. DQL/DRL(Data Query Language or Data Retrieve Language)
3. DML(Data Manipulation Language)
4. DCL(Data Control Language)
5. TCL(Transaction Control Language)

● DDL( Data Definition Language) -
DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that
can be used to define the database schema. DDL commands are mentioned
below -
● CREATE: Create TABLE, DATABASE, INDEX or VIEW
● DROP: Delete TABLE, DATABASE, or INDEX
● ALTER TABLE: Add/Remove columns from table
● TRUNCATE: Removes all records from a table.
● RENAME: Rename an existing object in the table.

● DQL(Data Query Language) -
DQL consists of commands that can feasibly retrieve the data from the
database using a single command. DQL commands are mentioned below -
● SELECT: Select data from database.
● DML(Data Manipulation Language) -
DML commands are used to make modifications to the database. DQL
commands are given below -
● INSERT: Insert data into a table.
● UPDATE: Update table data.

● DELETE: Delete rows from a table.
● DCL(Data Control Language)-
DCL commands are used to grant and take back authority from users.
DCL commands are given below -
● GRANT: Access privileges to the database.
● REVOKE: Withdraws the user’s access privileges.
● TCL(Transaction Control Language)-
TCL commands are used to manage transactions done in the database. Some
of the TCL commands are given below -
● BEGIN TRANSACTION: It is used to begin a transaction.
● COMMIT: It used to apply changes and end transactions.
● ROLLBACK: It used to discard changes and end transactions.
● SAVEPOINT: It points within the groups of transactions in which to
ROLLBACK.
● Concept of Dual tables:
Can we use the SELECT command without using FROM keyword (or without
using Tables)? 
● This could be achieved using the Dual Tables concept.
● Definition - Dual Tables are dummy tables that are already created by
MySQL itself. The significance of dual tables is that we can make
temporary changes without disturbing the user-defined tables. 
● You can find the current time of the system, can perform mathematical
calculations using dual tables, convert the string from lower-case to
upper-case and vice-versa, etc.
Syntax :
SELECT <STATEMENT_TO_EXECUTE>;

Example:
1. SELECT 1000 + 100;
Output: 1100
2. SELECT ucase(“coding ninjas”);
Output CODING NINJAS
Other keywords - NOW(), current_timestamp(); will display time.
